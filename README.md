This repository contains code related to the paper "Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search through Modern Error-Correcting Codes" by Noam Touitou and Nissim Halabi.
In particular, this repository contains an implementation of the PCNN algorithm for nearest-neighbor search, as well as code for its evaluation against some baselines, as described in detail in the paper. 

Note that the code in this repository makes use of (a heavily modified version of) the python polar coding library in https://github.com/fr0mhell/python-polar-coding.
